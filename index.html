            <h3>Professionaly</h3>
            <h4>Web Designer based in Minnesota, USA</h4>
            <p>It's as if George Eliot was speaking to me when he said that.  After 20+ years in Hospitality Event Management I decided in 2020 that there was no better time to become what I was meant to be.  I was in a career that bolstered my natural ability to be organized, communicate clearly, work under tight deadlines,  resolve problems creatively, be detail oriented, and keep my cool under pressure.  Yes, there is some design and creativity in event management, but I really wanted to tap into that side of my brain more.  Becoming a Web Designer and Frontend Developer has scratched that itch.  I still get to see a project from beginning to end while using my natural talents and pushing myself creatively.  In particular, I really enjoy helping small businesses find their footprint online.  I have a passion for making the web an accessible place for everyone and delivering high quality service to all my clients.</p>

            <h3>Personally</h3>
            <h4>I'm raising two boys....need I say more.  </h4>
            <p>They say being a parent is both the most rewarding and most difficult thing you will do in your life.  I have to agree but I wouldn't give it up for anything.  They bring me so much joy and keep me on my toes.  In my "free" time I appreciate a good audio book, scrapbooking (the old school paper craft kind), and gardening.  I like traveling, but only to warm places.  Yes it does get extremely cold in Minnesota and our summers are way too short for my standards.  I am very much a homebody so Netflix and Youtube binging are right up my alley.  I love learning new things.  My current hot topics to research are all things homesteading, healthy habits/fitness, anything web design and developement, finance, and small business development.  I have always wanted to write a book so that is on the bucket list, along with learning how to crochet (so I can make blankets for my future grandbabies).</p>
